<p> To earn more by working harder and smarter, I worked towards a sales career during most of my time at Wabash College. But in my senior year, I realized through feedback, personality assessments, and self-reflection that I'm a better fit for analytical roles.</p>

<p>Since I generally enjoyed investing in stocks as a hobby since 2009, aced all my accounting classes, taught accounting during my study abroad in China, and learned Excel, I accepted a role with The Fountain Trust Company. I took an online tutorial on visual basic to meet all the qualifications before I interviewed.</p> 

<p>I helped the management team, auditors, and regulators make decisions through financial reports, analyzed bonds, and served trust customers.I generally liked the work, but I eventually want to start a family which would be difficult in rural Covington, IN.</p>

<p>I realized through data that finance was overcrowded, but the world needed more tech talent.  Programming sounded amazing since I loved "getting in the zone" as I think and bring ideas into reality.  I choose Eleven Fifty Academy because employers shape their curriculum, they aim to fill unmet skills needs, and I could afford the program.</p>

<p>In Eleven Fifty, I discovered that I especially enjoy front-end development because I love making apps and websites look like I imagine.  I most looked forward to design aspects of projects, and I learned additional techniques on my own like favicons, paralax backgrounds, and slideshows. I still learned some back-end to be more useful.</p>

<p>I enjoy working because I feel good when I know I'm creating value.  I enjoy learning new development techniques, learning and using spoken languages, exercising, reading, listening to audiobooks, and value investing.</p>
